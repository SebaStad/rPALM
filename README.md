rPALM provides R6 classes to create and edit static drivers for the
urban climate model PALM-4U.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of rPALM from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

    install.packages("rPALM")

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("SebaStad/rPALM")

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

    library(rPALM)
    ## basic example code

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

    summary(cars)

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-markdown_strict/pressure-1.png)

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub!
